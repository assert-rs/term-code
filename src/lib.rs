//! ## Features
//!
//! - `i32` newtype for exit codes
//!   - Can represent any valid exit code
//!   - Type safe, operations are restricted to what is valid for exit codes
//! - Includes standard exit codes and signal exit codes
//! - Integrate with `main`, `std::process`, and `std::io::Error`
//! - Supports exiting silently (error message reported through another means)
//!
//! ## Install
//!
//! Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! proc-exit = "1.0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! Feature flags:
//! - `portable`:  Coerce exit codes to `u8` for consistent, cross-platform, behavior
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! fn main() {
//!     // Simple but Macro-less `main`
//!     // - Fast compiles
//!     // - Composable with other features
//!     let result = run();
//!     proc_exit::exit(result);
//! }
//!
//! fn run() -> proc_exit::ExitResult {
//!     // Integrates directly with `std::io::Error`, returning the right exit code.
//!     let exit_status = std::process::Command::new("true")
//!          .status()?;
//!     // Can pass `Command` exit codes right up, when appropriate
//!     proc_exit::Code::from_status(exit_status).ok()?;
//!
//!     proc_exit::Code::SUCCESS.ok()
//! }
//! ```
//!

//! Other crates that might be useful in testing command line programs.
//! - [duct][duct] for orchestrating multiple processes.
//!   - or [commandspec][commandspec] for easier writing of commands
//! - [rexpect][rexpect] for controlling interactive programs.
//! - [`assert_cmd`][assert_cmd] can be reused to simplify controlling CLIs

//! ## References
//!
//! As a basis it encodes the exit codes of [sysexits(3)][sysexits] from OpenBSD (64-78), exit statuses used by [bash][appendix-e],
//! supplemented by codes created by shells when the command is terminated
//! by a fatal signal.  When the fatal signal is a number _N_, the latter
//! follows bash's strategy of using the value 128 + _N_ as the exit status.
//! This means that the `SIGHUP` (1) signal will be recognised as the exit code
//! for the number 129.  Signal codes were taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#SIGALRM)
